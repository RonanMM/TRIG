# How To Use
start off by starting venv with

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

This will make your VSCode terminal show a `(venv)` prompt and should also,
hopefully, make it recognise `aiohttp`.

Run the backend with 

```
(venv) $ python3 main.py
```

`(venv) $` indicates that you are inside the virutalenv.``

if aiohttp is not installed, run

```
python3 -m pip install aiohttp
```

then run the backend again.
